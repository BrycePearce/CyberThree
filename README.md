# CyberThree

**🌐 Live Demo**: https://unrivaled-chimera-8e5859.netlify.app/

A cyberpunk-inspired ThreeJS experiment initially created to try out Claude which [turned out badly](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/273920762312916992/1324832357038948462/20250103-2010-27.1127413.mp4?ex=679696c8&is=67954548&hm=5f7fb45a4a8abe782e1a3984cd95fd716174d83cbf6e45c80bc8249f7b5dbd96&), but inspired manual intervention- learning ThreeJS in the process. Built with React Three Fiber, featuring dynamic shaders, particle systems, and interactive grid effects.
